In the past, adult-sized changing stations have been uncommon in museums, libraries, and other public places. However, these locations are making an effort to become just as accessible to people with special needs as they are to those who are ambulatory. With the UCT Locator, it is easier than ever for people with disablities and caregivers to find nearby adult-sized changing stations.</p>
