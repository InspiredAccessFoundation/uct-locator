# Into the Code
There is a lot of code in this project, and it can be a little overwhelming to jump into it. Many different folders, many files, all doing different things - and it can be very difficult to figure out what's actually happening.

## Self-Paced Learning
Using some online resources to learn more about some of the technologies can also be extremely helpful. It will give you at least a baseline of understanding before you try to get into everything.

## Jumping Into It
Surprisingly, sometimes the easiest way to start to understand something is to try to find a way to change it. Start working on one of the issues in the [backlog](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/uct-locator/projects/1), dig around in the codebase, and try to update a file ro two to complete the issue. [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) is highly recommended, especially in the beginning.
