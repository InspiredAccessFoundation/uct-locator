# Basic Background: Web Development & Command Line
A fundamental knowledge of basic web development and the command line will be necessary to start working on this project.

You should be at least basically familiar with three languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

For a very quick half-hour crash course on all three topics, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTMOmRrqkU).

The command line/terminal will also be used - for a quick interactive introduction, play [this game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/).

## Learning HTML and CSS
There are several ways to go about learning HTML and CSS. Everybody learns differently, so feel free to decide what works best for you! 

- [Building a Webpage Activity](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/HtmlCssLesson.html)
    - This quick introductory activity goes over the basics of HTML and CSS
- [Hy-Tech Club: Web 101](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-101/)
    - This course covers the basics of HTML and CSS, and the curriculum can be followed independently
- [W3 Schools: HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
    - This walks through almost every HTML concept, and is quite in-depth - it is still beginner-focused
- [W3 Schools: CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    - This walks through almost every CSS concept, and is quite in-depth - it is still beginner-focused
- [Codecademy: HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
    - This interactive tutorial covers the basics (and some more advanced concepts) of HTML - it is free, but an account is required
- [Codecademy: CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
    - This interactive tutorial covers the basics of CSS - it is free, but an account is required

## Learning JavaScript
Like with HTML/CSS, there are several resources out there to help you learn JavaScript.

- [Hy-Tech Club: Web 102](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/)
    - This course covers the basics of HTML and CSS, and the curriculum can be followed independently
- [W3 Schools: JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
    - This walks through some basic JavaScript concepts - it should still be approachable for beginners
- [Codecademy: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
    - This interactive tutorial covers the basics of JavaScript - it is free, but an account is required

The entire project relies heavily on JavaScript; both the front-end _and_ the back-end use JavaScript.

### JavaScript Concepts
There are some JavaScript concepts that are used throughout the codebase - some of these are not covered by the basic tutorials. It can be helpful to try to understand these concepts before diving into the code.

- [`const`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_const.asp): Several variables are declared using the `const` keyword, instead of `var` or `let`.
- [Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp): Objects are the most basic form of data in JavaScript. They are used heavily throughout the codebase.
- [JSON data](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp): This is the form of the data sent between the front-end and back-end of the product.
- [Template literals](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp): This is another way to create strings in JavaScript.
- [Arrow Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp): This is another way to write functions in JavaScript. These are often used as callbacks.
- [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import): This is one way to include libraries of other code into a JavaScript file.
- [Module exports](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/module-exports-how-to-export-in-node-js-and-javascript/): The other side of the `import`, this is how code is exported from a JavaScript file.
- [Promises](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp): These are a fairly complex way to handle asynchronicity in JavaScript. Most of the code does not work with promises directly, and uses `async`/`await` instead.
- [`async`/`await`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp): This paradigm makes promises easier to write. `async` and `await` are typically used when retrieving data from the database, or waiting for a response request.
- [`map`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp): This is a way to iterate over an array.

Many of these concepts are quite advanced, so don't worry if you don't fully grasp all of them!

## Command Line
It may be helpful and necessary to utilize the command line/terminal when developing this application. [Here](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201/CommandLine/StudentDesc.html) is a lesson introducing the concept of a command line interface. You can also play the [Terminus game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/) for a fun, interactive introductions to some commands.
